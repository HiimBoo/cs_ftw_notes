Here is another note about the workflow that you will repeat over and over again:
- Create a new folder for the project/assignment
- git init to initialize git for version control
- Work on the project/assignment
- git add * to take all of your changes to the staging area
- git commit -m "a meaningful message"
- Keep working on another feature, commit your code often to make sure you don't lose it or you can undo things
- After you finish, create a Github repository on the Github website
- git remote add origin the_url_of_your_github_repo to connect your local repo with the Github repo
- git push origin master to push your code to the Github repo
- It's ok to keep working on your project, just remember to push your most recent code to Github repo
- Send the link of your Github repo to Minh
