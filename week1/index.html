    <h1>Intro to HTML</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>The front-end of the web is based on three major technologies:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong> HTML aka "STRUCTURE":</strong> HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
        defines the structure, content and semantics of web pages on the web.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>CSS aka "PRESENTATION":</strong> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
        sets the look and style of a web page. CSS provides style to the
        structure provided by HTML.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>JavaScript aka "BEHAVIOR":</strong> JavaScript allows us to
        define interaction in our pages. What happens when a user clicks on a
        certain area?
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Today, we will build a foundation of HTML knowledge and skills.</p>

    <h2>What is HTML</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>
      HTML is used to create electronic documents (pages) that are displayed on
      the Web.
    </p>

    <p>
      HTML ensures the proper formatting of content (text, images, video) so
      that your browser can display them as intended. As a result, HTML is made
      up of many elements. These elements are used to hold our content and
      define how the browser must format and display the content. The term
      markup refers to the set of tags used to structure a page.

    <h2>The anatomy of an HTML Element</h2>

    <p><strong> Elements</strong> are identified by<strong> tags</strong>. A tag consists of the element name within angle brackets (< >). A tag starts with an<strong> opening tag</strong> and ends with a<strong> closing tag</strong> preceded by </. The tags are referred to as the markup.</p>
    <p>Elements which are created with only one tag are called empty elements (also known as self-closing elements) and cannot have any child elements. Examples of this are<em> < img ></em>and <em> < input ></em>.</p>
    <p>In HTML, the capitalization of element names is not important. So <img>, <Img>, and <IMG> are all the same. However, most developers prefer the consistency of writing element names in all lowercase.</p>
